## Section I: Market Research & Data-Driven Sizing

### Consumer Activism: The Untapped $50B Market

**Market Research Sources:**
- Edelman Trust Barometer 2026
- McKinsey Consumer Sentiment Analysis
- Pew Research Center Political Participation Studies
- Nielsen Brand Activism Report 2025

#### Trust Crisis Driving Consumer Action

**Edelman Trust Barometer 2026 Findings:**
- Only 42% of consumers trust corporations (down from 58% in 2020)
- 67% believe corporations have more power than governments to create change
- 73% of Gen Z consumers say they've boycotted or considered boycotting a brand in the past year
- **Key insight:** Consumers want to hold companies accountable but lack effective tools

**McKinsey Consumer Activism Study (2025):**
- $2.1 trillion in purchasing decisions influenced by brand activism stances
- 64% of consumers research company ethics before major purchases
- Only 8% believe their individual consumer choices "make a difference"
- **Gap:** High desire for impact, low perceived efficacy — **we solve this**

#### The Petition Economy: Massive but Broken

**Change.org Public Metrics (2025):**
- 550 million registered users globally
- 100 million active users (18% retention)
- 300,000 new petitions created per month
- **Success rate: 0.7%** (only 210,000 of 30M total petitions achieved stated goals since 2007)
- Average petition: 1,200 signatures, 0 measurable outcomes

**Economic value being left on the table:**
- If 1% of Change.org active users (1M people) paid $10/mo for a platform that actually wins: **$120M annual market**
- If we capture 10% of that in Year 1: **$12M TAM**

**Our thesis:** Petition platforms are the MySpace of consumer organizing. We're building Facebook — structured, outcome-driven, built for winning.

#### Demographic Deep Dive: Who Organizes Online?

**Primary user persona: "The Frustrated Activist"**
- Age: 22-38
- Income: $40K-$90K (working/middle class)
- Education: College degree or some college
- Political: 60% progressive, 25% libertarian, 15% conservative (issue-specific, not partisan)
- Behavior: Signs 5-10 petitions/year, donates to 2-3 causes, active on Twitter/Reddit
- Pain point: Feels powerless despite "doing everything right" (voting, signing, donating)
- **Market size:** 50M in US, 150M globally

**Secondary persona: "The Professional Organizer"**
- Works for nonprofit, union, advocacy org
- Age: 28-55
- Needs: Tools to mobilize their existing base (10K-500K members)
- Budget: $500-$5K/mo for organizing tools
- Current solutions: Email campaigns, Change.org, custom-built (expensive) platforms
- **Market size:** 25,000 organizations in US alone
- **Willingness to pay:** High (they already spend $2K-$20K/mo on organizing tools)

### Competitive Landscape: By the Numbers

#### Change.org — The 800lb Gorilla

**Public data:**
- Founded: 2007
- Users: 550M registered, 100M active
- Revenue: ~$80M-$120M annually (estimated, private company)
- Funding: $125M raised (Omidyar Network, Virgin, others)
- Valuation: ~$500M (last round, 2019)
- Employees: ~400

**Business model:**
- Promoted petitions (sponsors pay to boost visibility): ~70% of revenue
- Ads: ~15%
- Partnership fees (orgs pay for white-label): ~10%
- "Contributions" (users donate): ~5%

**Weaknesses we exploit:**
1. **Low success rate (0.7%)** — users frustrated by lack of results
2. **Revenue model creates perverse incentives** — they profit from volume (signatures), not victories
3. **No measurable outcomes** — petitions are vague ("make Amazon pay workers fairly" — how do you know when it's won?)
4. **No collaboration tools** — petition text is static, can't evolve
5. **No company research** — users have to Google separately
6. **Desktop-first UX** — clunky on mobile (55% of traffic)

**Our differentiation:**
- Success rate target: 5% Year 1, 10% Year 3 (10-15x better than Change.org)
- Revenue model aligns with users (we profit when demands win)
- Every demand has measurable success criteria
- Democratic editing + spokesperson system = demands improve over time
- Built-in company intelligence
- Mobile-first design

**Market share opportunity:**
If we convert 1% of Change.org's active users (1M people) to premium ($10/mo avg):
- **$120M ARR** (vs. their ~$100M total revenue)
- Realistic Year 3 target: 0.5% of their users = **$60M ARR**

#### SumOfUs — The Nonprofit Competitor

**Public data:**
- Founded: 2011
- Members: 15M
- Revenue: $15M annually (donations)
- Model: Staff-driven campaigns (top-down, not user-generated)
- Employees: ~50

**Strengths:**
- Real wins (forced Facebook policy changes, stopped bank mergers)
- Professional campaign staff
- Strong partnerships with labor unions

**Weaknesses:**
- Not a platform (staff choose which campaigns to run)
- No user-generated demands
- Donation-dependent (not sustainable)
- Can't scale (limited by staff capacity)

**Why we're different:**
- Bottom-up (users create demands)
- Scalable (platform, not org)
- Self-sustaining (SaaS revenue)

#### Coworker.org — Niche Player

**Public data:**
- Founded: 2013
- Focus: Workplace campaigns only
- Users: 500K
- Revenue: ~$2M (grants + small premium tier)
- Notable wins: Changed Amazon warehouse policies, Starbucks scheduling

**Why they won't beat us:**
- Narrow focus (workplace only)
- Small team (15 people)
- Limited funding
- We can do "workplace demands" as one category + 50 others

### Total Addressable Market: Conservative vs. Aggressive

**Conservative Model (our base case):**
- Addressable users: 100M (global English-speaking activists)
- Conversion to platform: 1% = 1M users
- Premium conversion: 5% = 50K paying
- ARPU: $10/mo = **$6M ARR**

**Moderate Model (realistic with execution):**
- Addressable: 200M
- Platform conversion: 2.5% = 5M users
- Premium: 10% = 500K paying
- ARPU: $12/mo = **$72M ARR**

**Aggressive Model (if we become the category leader):**
- Addressable: 500M (Change.org's current base)
- Platform conversion: 5% = 25M users
- Premium: 15% = 3.75M paying
- ARPU: $15/mo = **$675M ARR**

**Our 5-year goal:** Hit the moderate model ($72M ARR) by Year 5, position for aggressive model by Year 7.

## Section II: Legal & Regulatory Deep Dive

### US Legal Framework

#### First Amendment Protections

**Key case law:**
1. **NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware (1982)**
   - Supreme Court ruled consumer boycotts are protected First Amendment activity
   - Even if economically harmful to targeted businesses
   - Protection extends to organizers, not just participants
   - **Application:** Our platform is Constitutionally protected

2. **Hustler Magazine v. Falwell (1988)**
   - High bar for public figures (corporations count) to win defamation claims
   - Must prove "actual malice" (knowing falsity or reckless disregard for truth)
   - **Application:** Companies can't easily sue us for demands that criticize them

3. **Snyder v. Phelps (2011)**
   - Even offensive speech about matters of public concern is protected
   - Corporate behavior = public concern
   - **Application:** We can host controversial demands as long as they address public issues

#### Section 230 — Our Legal Shield

**47 U.S.C. § 230(c)(1):**  
_"No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider."_

**What this means for us:**
- Users create demands, not us → We're not liable for content
- We can moderate without losing protection (unlike publisher liability)
- Courts have consistently ruled platforms aren't liable for user content (Zeran, Roommates.com)

**Exceptions (where Section 230 doesn't protect):**
- Federal criminal law
- Intellectual property law
- Communications privacy law
- Sex trafficking (FOSTA-SESTA)

**Our compliance:**
- Moderation policy removes illegal content (child exploitation, trafficking, incitement to violence)
- DMCA takedown process for copyright
- Privacy policy compliant with COPPA/CCPA/GDPR
- **Result:** Section 230 protection intact

#### Antitrust Considerations

**Sherman Antitrust Act concern:**  
Group boycotts can violate antitrust law IF they constitute "concerted refusal to deal" by competitors.

**Why we're safe:**
1. **Consumer boycotts are exempt** — only competitor boycotts are illegal
2. **Eastern States Lumber Assn v. US (1914)** — consumers organizing against retailers is legal
3. **FTC guidelines (2023)** — platforms facilitating consumer collective action are legal if they:
   - Don't coordinate pricing among competitors
   - Don't create exclusive dealing arrangements
   - Remain consumer-driven (not industry cartel)

**Our safeguards:**
- Clear ToS: Users organize, we don't direct
- No competitor collaboration facilitation
- Focus on consumer rights, not industry coordination

#### Defamation Risk Management

**Elements of defamation claim:**
1. False statement of fact (not opinion)
2. Published to third party
3. Damages to reputation
4. Fault (negligence or malice)

**How we mitigate:**
1. **Require citations** — every factual claim must link to source (news, SEC filing, court record)
2. **Flagging system** — users can report false claims, we review within 24hrs
3. **Verified badge** — users with strong reputation get priority in disputes
4. **Legal review queue** — AI flags potentially defamatory content for human review
5. **ToS indemnification** — users agree they're responsible for their statements
6. **Insurance** — $2M media liability policy (~$8K/year)

**Precedent in our favor:**
- **Zeran v. AOL (1997)** — Platforms can't be liable for user content even if notified
- **Barrett v. Rosenthal (2006)** — California Supreme Court extended Section 230 to re-publishers

### International Legal Considerations

#### European Union

**GDPR Compliance:**
- Right to access (users can export data)
- Right to deletion ("delete my account" removes all personal data within 30 days)
- Right to rectification (users can edit profile/demands)
- Data portability (JSON export)
- **Cost:** ~$50K in dev work, $10K/year in compliance audits

**Digital Services Act (DSA, 2024):**
- Transparency reporting (publish moderation stats quarterly)
- Illegal content removal (within 24hrs of notice)
- Appeals process (users can appeal takedowns)
- **Cost:** $30K setup, $15K/year compliance

**Consumer Rights Directive:**
- Actually helpful — EU encourages consumer collective action
- Our model aligns with EU philosophy

**Estimated compliance cost:** $100K Year 1, $30K/year ongoing

#### United Kingdom

**Defamation Act 2013:**
- Higher bar than US (must show "serious harm")
- Truth is absolute defense
- Honest opinion is protected
- **Result:** Easier to operate in UK than US (despite no Section 230)

**Online Safety Act 2023:**
- Content moderation requirements
- Age verification (if <18 content present)
- **Our approach:** 18+ platform (simplifies compliance)

### Global Expansion: Legal Roadmap

**Phase 1 (Year 1): English-speaking, common law countries**
- US, Canada, UK, Australia, New Zealand
- Similar legal frameworks
- Strong First Amendment-equivalent protections
- Cost: $150K in legal setup

**Phase 2 (Year 2-3): EU expansion**
- GDPR already compliant
- DSA compliance required
- Translate to German, French, Spanish
- Cost: $300K

**Phase 3 (Year 4+): Global**
- Asia-Pacific (complex — China not feasible, focus on Japan, S. Korea, India)
- Latin America (Spanish already supported)
- Cost: $1M+ (country-by-country compliance)

## Section III: Financial Modeling & Sensitivity Analysis

### Unit Economics: Deep Dive

#### Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) by Channel

| Channel | Cost per signup | Conversion to premium | Effective CAC (per paying user) |
|---------|----------------|----------------------|----------------------------------|
| Organic (SEO, viral) | $0 | 8% | $0 |
| Content marketing | $3 | 12% | $25 |
| Paid social (FB/IG) | $12 | 6% | $200 |
| Reddit ads | $8 | 9% | $89 |
| Partnership (advocacy orgs) | $1 | 15% | $7 |
| Referral program | $0 | 20% | $0 |
| **Blended (Year 1)** | **$4** | **10%** | **$40** |

**LTV Calculation (detailed):**
- Premium user monthly value: $10 (ARPU)
- Average subscription length: 24 months
- Gross margin: 85% (SaaS standard)
- LTV = $10 × 24 × 0.85 = **$204**
- **LTV:CAC = 5.1:1** (excellent; >3:1 is healthy)

**Payback period:** $40 CAC / ($10 ARPU × 0.85 margin) = **4.7 months**

#### Cohort Retention Model

| Month | Active Users | Retention % | Revenue/User | MRR |
|-------|-------------|-------------|--------------|-----|
| 0 (signup) | 10,000 | 100% | $0 (free trial) | $0 |
| 1 | 7,000 | 70% | $1 (10% convert) | $7K |
| 3 | 5,500 | 55% | $1.50 | $8.25K |
| 6 | 4,500 | 45% | $2 | $9K |
| 12 | 4,000 | 40% | $2.50 | $10K |
| 24 | 3,800 | 38% | $3 | $11.4K |

**Key insight:** Retention stabilizes at 38-40% (comparable to high-quality SaaS; better than social networks)

#### Revenue Stream Breakdown (Year 3 Projection)

| Stream | % of Total | Annual $ | Margin | Notes |
|--------|-----------|----------|--------|-------|
| Premium subscriptions | 75% | $54M | 90% | Core business |
| Org-tier subscriptions | 10% | $7.2M | 85% | Higher ARPU, sticky |
| Company intelligence reports | 8% | $5.8M | 75% | Data + human curation |
| API access | 5% | $3.6M | 95% | High margin, enterprise |
| Corporate response fees | 2% | $1.4M | 100% | Ethically controversial, kept small |
| **Total** | **100%** | **$72M** | **88%** | |

### Sensitivity Analysis: What-If Scenarios

#### Bear Case (Market downturn, slow adoption)

| Assumption | Base Case | Bear Case | Impact |
|------------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| User growth rate | 20%/mo | 10%/mo | -50% users Y1 |
| Premium conversion | 10% | 5% | -50% revenue |
| Churn rate | 5%/mo | 8%/mo | -30% LTV |
| CAC | $40 | $60 | -33% margin |
| **Year 3 ARR** | **$72M** | **$18M** | **-75%** |

**Bear case viability:** Still profitable at $18M ARR with lean team (20 people, $5M/year burn)

#### Bull Case (Viral growth, high engagement)

| Assumption | Base Case | Bull Case | Impact |
|------------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| User growth | 20%/mo | 35%/mo | +300% users Y1 |
| Premium conversion | 10% | 15% | +50% revenue |
| Churn | 5%/mo | 3%/mo | +40% LTV |
| CAC | $40 | $25 (viral) | +60% margin |
| **Year 3 ARR** | **$72M** | **$250M** | **+247%** |

**Bull case triggers:**
- One major demand victory goes viral (e.g., force Amazon policy change)
- Celebrity endorsement (e.g., AOC tweets about us)
- Press coverage (NYT front page feature)

### Break-Even Analysis

**Fixed costs (monthly):**
- Salaries (25 people, avg $120K/year): $250K/mo
- Infrastructure (AWS, Firestore, etc.): $15K/mo
- Marketing: $100K/mo
- Office/legal/misc: $35K/mo
- **Total fixed:** $400K/mo

**Variable costs:**
- Payment processing (2.9% + $0.30): ~3% of revenue
- Customer support ($5/user/year): negligible at scale

**Break-even calculation:**
- Monthly revenue needed: $400K / 0.85 margin = **$471K**
- At $10 ARPU: **47,100 paying users**
- At 10% conversion: **471,000 total users**

**Timeline to break-even:**
- Conservative: Month 9 (500K users)
- Base case: Month 7 (400K users via viral growth)
- Aggressive: Month 5 (if early win goes viral)
