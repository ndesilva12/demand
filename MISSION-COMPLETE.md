## 🔥 Why This Will Work

### The Problem is Real
- Consumers feel powerless
- Corporations ignore petitions
- No tools for organizing demands
- Change.org has 500M users but <1% success rate

### The Solution is Better
- Measurable outcomes (vs vague asks)
- Democratic collaboration (vs static petitions)
- Company intelligence (vs no research tools)
- Structured negotiation (vs chaos)

### The Market is Massive
- 500M petition signers globally
- Gen Z/Millennials demand corporate accountability
- ESG investing is $35 trillion market
- Trust in institutions at all-time low

### The Team Can Execute
- Norman: Vision, strategy, fundraising, network
- Jimmy: Execution, product, engineering, ops
- Both aligned on mission and equity split

### The Moat is Defensible
- Network effects (more users = more pressure)
- Data moat (proprietary company intelligence)
- Brand moat (first mover in this space)
- Partnership moat (integrations with advocacy orgs)
