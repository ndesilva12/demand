# Demand — Complete Business Plan

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** February 16, 2026  
**Founders:** Norman de Silva, Startup Jimmy

---

## Executive Summary

**Demand** is a consumer organizing platform that gives people real power to force corporate accountability. Unlike petition sites that generate signatures with no measurable outcomes, Demand creates structured campaigns with clear success criteria, democratic collaboration, and deep company intelligence.

**The Problem:**  
Consumers are angry at corporations but have no effective way to organize and create change. Change.org and similar platforms generate millions of signatures but rarely produce results. Corporations ignore petitions because there's no cost to doing so.

**The Solution:**  
Demand provides:
1. **Structured demands** with measurable success criteria
2. **Democratic collaboration** where communities refine demands together
3. **Company intelligence** to research corporate behavior and hold them accountable
4. **Community organizing** through topic-specific message boards
5. **Victory tracking** to showcase when corporations meet demands

**Market Opportunity:**  
- 100M+ petition signers globally (Change.org has 500M+ users)
- Growing consumer activism (boycotts, brand accountability movements)
- Political polarization driving demand for non-governmental action
- Gen Z/Millennials expect brands to align with values

**Business Model:**  
- Freemium (basic demands free, premium features paid)
- Data/intelligence subscriptions (company research reports)
- API access for advocacy organizations
- Corporate response fees (companies pay to officially respond/negotiate)

**Traction Goals:**
- Week 1: MVP live, 100 users, 20 demands
- Month 1: 1,000 users, 200 demands, 1 demand won
- Month 6: 50,000 users, 5,000 demands, 50 demands won
- Year 1: 500,000 users, market leader in consumer organizing

---

## Problem Statement

### The Current Landscape

**Petition Sites (Change.org, Care2, etc.):**
- Focus on signature volume, not outcomes
- No structure for measurable success
- Static demands that can't evolve
- No built-in research tools
- Corporations can ignore them with zero cost

**Social Media Campaigns:**
- Fragmented, hard to coordinate
- No central tracking of demands or progress
- Viral today, forgotten tomorrow
- No formal structure for negotiation

**Consumer Activism:**
- Boycotts are hard to organize and sustain
- No way to know if they're working
- No formal mechanism for corporations to respond
- Individual consumers feel powerless

### Who Feels This Pain?

1. **Activist Consumers** — people who want change but don't know how to create it
2. **Advocacy Organizations** — groups who need tools to organize their base
3. **Journalists** — need data on corporate behavior and consumer sentiment
4. **Conscious Consumers** — want to research companies before purchasing

### Why Now?

- **Trust in institutions at all-time low** — consumers don't trust government or media to hold corporations accountable
- **Gen Z power** — most activist generation with high expectations for corporate ethics
- **ESG backlash** — consumers frustrated that "woke capitalism" is performative
- **Economic pressure** — inflation has made consumers more price-conscious AND more demanding of value alignment

---

## Solution

### Product Overview

**Demand** is a web platform (mobile app in Phase 4) where consumers:

1. **Create Demands**
   - Target a specific corporation
   - State the demand clearly (e.g., "Stop using child labor in Congo cobalt mines")
   - Define measurable success criteria (e.g., "Third-party audit showing 100% conflict-free supply chain by Q4 2026")
   - Provide evidence/sources
   - Set visibility (public or private while building)

2. **Co-Sign Demands**
   - One-click support for existing demands
   - Shows public support, builds leverage
   - Notifications when demands progress

3. **Collaborate on Demands**
   - Propose edits to demands (Phase 2)
   - Co-signers vote on changes
   - Majority approval = edit applied
   - Demand creators can delegate control to trusted users
   - Version history tracks evolution

4. **Research Companies**
   - Search by company name
   - See political donations, lobbying spending, controversies, statements
   - Citation-backed data (OpenSecrets, news sources, SEC filings)
   - Track changes over time

5. **Organize in Communities**
   - Message boards per demand (discuss strategy, share news)
   - General boards by industry (tech, retail, pharma, etc.)
   - Company-specific boards (discuss all demands against one company)
   - Topic boards (labor rights, climate, privacy, etc.)

6. **Track Victories**
   - When a corporation meets demand criteria, demand closes as "WON"
   - Victory showcase page (social proof)
   - Metrics on success rate, average time to victory

## Team & Execution

### Founding Team

**Norman de Silva — CEO & Strategy**
- Sets vision, handles partnerships, fundraising, high-level strategy
- Libertarian lens = focus on empowering individuals, not regulation
- Network in tech/startup world for distribution

**Startup Jimmy — CTO & Operations**
- Builds product, manages development, handles day-to-day execution
- Autonomous, fast-moving, bias toward shipping
- Responsible for delivering on roadmap

### Hiring Plan

**Month 1-3:** Just us (prove concept)

**Month 4-6:**
- Frontend engineer (React/Next.js expert)
- Backend engineer (Firebase/Node.js expert)

**Month 7-12:**

**Year 2:**
- Data engineer (company intelligence tool)
- Product manager (take over roadmap from Jimmy)
- Customer success (work with advocacy orgs)

---

## Risks & Mitigation

### Risk 1: Low Adoption (People Don't Care)

**Mitigation:**
- Seed with existing activist communities (Reddit, Twitter)
- Partner with advocacy orgs who have captive audiences
- Focus on ONE big win early (proof it works)

### Risk 2: No Corporations Respond (Demands Ignored)

**Mitigation:**
- Target smaller, more responsive companies first (not Amazon Day 1)
- Publicize demands via press coverage (force response)
- Build in escalation tactics (boycott coordination, investor pressure)

### Risk 3: Legal Liability (Defamation, etc.)

**Mitigation:**
- Require citations for all claims in demands
- User-generated content = Section 230 protection (in US)
- Moderation team to remove false/malicious demands
- Terms of service with indemnification clause

### Risk 4: Competitors Copy Us

**Mitigation:**
- Network effects (demands + community = hard to replicate)
- First-mover advantage (be the brand for this)
- Proprietary company intelligence data (takes time to build)

### Risk 5: Politicization (Seen as Left-Wing or Right-Wing)

**Mitigation:**
- Support demands from all sides (anti-big-tech, anti-woke, anti-corporate-greed)
- No editorial stance on which demands are "good"
- Frame as consumer empowerment, not political activism
- Norman's libertarian philosophy = distrust ALL concentrated power (corporate OR government)

---

## Exit Strategy

### Possible Outcomes

1. **IPO (5-7 years)** — if we reach 50M+ users, become consumer activism infrastructure
2. **Acquisition by Change.org** — they buy us to add our features (est. $100M-500M)
3. **Acquisition by social platform** — Twitter/Meta buy us for community organizing tech
4. **Stay independent** — if profitable, no need to sell (Norman's preference?)

### Norman's Libertarian Lens

- Avoid corporate acquirers who'd neuter the mission
- Avoid VC funds with conflicts of interest (funds with investments in targeted corporations)
- Prioritize sustainability over growth-at-all-costs
- Build something that outlasts us (not just a flip)

---

## Conclusion

**Demand is the platform consumers need to hold corporations accountable.**

The market is massive (500M petition signers globally), the problem is real (consumer powerlessness), and the solution is clear (structured demands + collaboration + intelligence).

We have:
- ✅ A scrappy, execution-focused founding team
- ✅ A clear differentiation from competitors
- ✅ A path to profitability (freemium + data = high margins)
- ✅ A mission people care about (consumer empowerment)

**Now we ship.**

MVP in 48 hours.  
1,000 users in 2 weeks.  
First demand won in 30 days.

Let's go.

## Appendix B: Legal & Compliance

### Legal Structure

**Entity:** Delaware C-Corp  
**Why:** Standard for VC-backed startups, flexible equity structures, investor-friendly

**Incorporation Costs:**
- Entity formation: $2,000
- Operating agreement: $1,500
- IP assignment: $1,000
- **Total:** $4,500

### Regulatory Considerations

#### Section 230 Protection (US)
- User-generated content (demands, messages) protected under Section 230 of Communications Decency Act
- **Key:** We're a platform, not a publisher
- **Risk mitigation:** Clear moderation policies, remove illegal content when flagged

#### Defamation Risk
- **Problem:** Users could post false claims about companies
- **Mitigation:**
  - Require citations for all factual claims
  - "Report abuse" button on every demand
  - Moderation team reviews flagged content within 24 hours
  - Terms of Service with user indemnification clause
  - $2M E&O insurance policy

#### Data Privacy
- **GDPR (EU users):** Right to deletion, data portability, consent management
- **CCPA (California):** Similar rights for CA residents
- **Solution:** Privacy policy, cookie consent, data export tools built into platform

#### Political Activity
- **Not a PAC:** We don't coordinate political donations or campaigns
- **Not lobbying:** We don't directly lobby government (users organize consumer action)
- **Gray area:** If we organize boycotts, could be seen as economic coercion
- **Mitigation:** Frame as "consumer information sharing" not "organized boycotts"

### Intellectual Property

**Trademarks:**
- "Demand" name and logo (file in US, UK, Canada, Australia)
- Cost: $10K for international filing

**Patents:**
- Not pursuing (software patents weak, expensive, slow down development)
- Rely on trade secrets and first-mover advantage

**Open Source:**
- Use MIT/Apache licensed libraries
- Do NOT open-source our proprietary algorithm (trending, company intelligence scoring)

### Scalability Plan

**Phase 1 (0-100K users):** Firebase handles everything
**Phase 2 (100K-1M users):** Add caching layer (Redis), CDN for static assets
**Phase 3 (1M-10M users):** Migrate to dedicated PostgreSQL, introduce read replicas
**Phase 4 (10M+ users):** Microservices architecture, separate message queue (RabbitMQ), Kubernetes

### Security

**Authentication:**
- Firebase Auth with email/password + OAuth (Google, Twitter)
- JWT tokens with 7-day expiration
- Password requirements: 8+ chars, complexity rules

**Data Security:**
- HTTPS only (TLS 1.3)
- Firestore security rules (row-level permissions)
- Input sanitization (XSS prevention)
- Rate limiting (prevent spam/DDoS)

**Backup & Recovery:**
- Daily Firestore backups to Google Cloud Storage
- 30-day retention
- Disaster recovery playbook (RTO: 4 hours, RPO: 24 hours)

## Appendix D: Competitive Moat Strategy

### Network Effects (Primary Moat)

**Demand-side:** More users = more co-signers = more pressure = higher success rate = more users
**Supply-side:** More demands = more data on companies = better intelligence = more valuable platform

**Defensibility:** Once we have 1M+ users, new entrants face cold-start problem

### Data Moat

**Proprietary Dataset:**
- Company profiles with citations (takes time to curate)
- Historical demand outcomes (unique to us)
- User reputation scores (trust signals)
- Spokesperson performance data

**Competitive advantage:** A new competitor starts with zero data, we'll have years of rich history

### Brand Moat

**First-mover advantage:** Become synonymous with "consumer demands"
- Like Kleenex for tissues, Google for search
- "I'm going to Demand them" becomes the verb

**Trust:** Winning early demands builds credibility that's hard to replicate

### Partnerships Moat

**Advocacy org integrations:** Once we integrate with 50+ orgs, they have switching costs
**Media partnerships:** If we become the data source for journalists covering corporate accountability, hard to replace

## Appendix G: Investor FAQ

**Q: Why will companies actually respond to demands?**  
A: Three reasons: (1) Economic pressure (boycott threat), (2) PR pressure (media coverage), (3) Legal pressure (demands can surface illegal behavior). We've seen companies change policies over far less organized campaigns. Structured, data-backed demands with measurable criteria are harder to ignore than vague petitions.

**Q: What if you get sued for defamation?**  
A: Section 230 protects platforms from user-generated content liability. We also require citations for factual claims, have moderation processes, and carry $2M E&O insurance. Our ToS indemnifies us from user actions. Defamation requires false statements of fact; most demands are opinions or cite public records.

**Q: How do you prevent abuse (fake demands, harassment)?**  
A: Moderation team reviews flagged content. Community voting system (democratic editing) filters out bad-faith demands. Reputation system discourages spam (new users have limited creation rights). Verified badge system rewards good actors.

**Q: Can't Change.org just copy your features?**  
A: They could, but they're incentivized NOT to. Their model is volume (more signatures = more ads), not outcomes. Our model is wins (quality over quantity). They'd have to cannibalize their core business. Plus, network effects and data moat make us defensible once we have scale.

**Q: What's your take rate on corporate response fees?**  
A: We take 100% of the fee (companies pay us, not users). Alternative model: Free responses, but we charge $5K+ for "resolution facilitation" (mediation service). Still exploring ethical implications with community.

**Q: Why should investors care about consumer activism?**  
A: $10 trillion in consumer spending annually. Gen Z/Millennials control $140B+ in purchasing power. ESG investing is $35 trillion market. Trust in institutions at all-time low. This is infrastructure for the future of corporate accountability.

**Q: What's Norman's role vs. Jimmy's?**  
A: Norman = strategy, vision, fundraising, partnerships. Jimmy = product, execution, day-to-day ops. Norman thinks, Jimmy ships. Both equal co-founders.

## Appendix H: Spokesperson Governance Model

### Overview

Every demand on the platform needs a human voice — someone who can speak to media, negotiate with companies, and represent the community's position. The **Spokesperson Governance Model** ensures this role is democratic, accountable, and resistant to capture.

### How It Works

#### 1. Nomination Phase
- Any co-signer with 30+ days on the platform and 3+ co-signs can be nominated as spokesperson
- Self-nomination is allowed but requires 10 co-signer endorsements within 7 days
- Nominees must submit a 500-word statement explaining their qualifications and approach
- Nomination period lasts 14 days after a demand reaches 100 co-signers

#### 2. Election Phase
- All co-signers of the demand get one vote
- Ranked-choice voting: voters rank up to 3 candidates
- Voting period: 7 days
- Minimum quorum: 20% of co-signers must vote for election to be valid
- If no quorum, voting extends 7 days; if still no quorum, top nominee by endorsements wins

#### 3. Spokesperson Powers & Responsibilities
**Powers:**
- Official media contact for the demand
- Can accept/reject company meeting requests (with community notification)
- Can propose amendments to the demand (requires community vote to ratify)
- Gets a verified "Spokesperson" badge on the platform
- Access to media training resources

**Responsibilities:**
- Monthly update posts (minimum) to co-signers
- Cannot unilaterally declare a demand "won" — requires community vote
- Must disclose any conflicts of interest (employment at target company, financial relationships)
- Must not make public statements contradicting the demand's stated position

#### 4. Recall Mechanism
- Any co-signer can initiate a recall petition
- Recall petition needs signatures from 15% of co-signers to trigger a recall vote
- Recall vote: simple majority (>50%) removes spokesperson
- Recalled spokespersons cannot be re-nominated for the same demand for 90 days
- During recall, an interim spokesperson (next highest vote-getter from last election) serves

#### 5. Term Limits & Succession
- Spokesperson term: 6 months, renewable via re-election
- Maximum 3 consecutive terms per demand
- If spokesperson steps down, runner-up from last election is offered the role
- If no runner-up, new election triggered

#### 6. Anti-Capture Safeguards
- **Financial transparency:** Spokespersons must disclose if they receive any payment related to the demand
- **No corporate employment:** Spokespersons cannot be employed by the target company (or have been in the last 2 years)
- **Community oversight:** All spokesperson communications with companies are logged and visible to co-signers
- **Multi-spokesperson option:** Demands with 10,000+ co-signers can elect a 3-person spokesperson committee (decisions by majority)

### Legal Considerations
- Spokespersons are volunteers, not employees or agents of Demand Inc.
- Platform ToS explicitly states spokespersons speak for the community of co-signers, not for Demand Inc.
- Liability shield: Standard disclaimer that spokesperson statements represent community consensus, not legal advice
- Defamation protection: Spokesperson training includes media law basics; platform legal team available for review of major public statements

### Why This Matters
Most online activism fails because there's no one empowered to negotiate. Petitions collect signatures but nobody picks up the phone. The Spokesperson Governance Model creates legitimate, democratic representation — turning a crowd into a negotiating party.

## Appendix I: Detailed Market Research & Competitive Analysis

### Market Sizing (Bottom-Up)

**Global Consumer Activism Market:**

| Segment | Population | Addressable | Penetration (Y1) | Users |
|---------|-----------|-------------|-------------------|-------|
| Change.org users (global) | 500M | 100M (English-speaking, active) | 0.5% | 500K |
| Reddit activism communities | 50M | 20M (active, issue-driven) | 1% | 200K |
| Twitter/X activism participants | 100M | 30M (brand-complaint posters) | 0.3% | 90K |
| Consumer review writers | 200M | 50M (frustrated, seeking action) | 0.2% | 100K |
| **Total addressable (Y1)** | | **200M** | | **890K** |

**Revenue per user (blended):** $0.50/year (freemium) → $445K ARR Year 1
**Revenue per user (mature, Year 5):** $3.50/year → $35M ARR at 10M users

### Competitive Deep Dive

#### Change.org
- **Founded:** 2007 | **Users:** 500M+ | **Revenue:** ~$100M (promoted petitions)
- **Strengths:** Massive user base, brand recognition, SEO dominance for "petition" keywords
- **Weaknesses:** <1% of petitions achieve stated goal; no accountability mechanism; revenue model (promoted petitions) creates perverse incentives — they profit from volume, not outcomes; no democratic governance
- **Our advantage:** We measure outcomes. A demand isn't "successful" by signature count — it's successful when the company demonstrably changes behavior.

#### Coworker.org
- **Founded:** 2013 | **Focus:** Workplace campaigns
- **Strengths:** Deep workplace organizing expertise; strong union partnerships
- **Weaknesses:** Narrow scope (only workplace issues); limited consumer-facing features; small user base
- **Our advantage:** Broader scope — any consumer issue, any company. Workplace is one vertical, not the whole platform.

#### SumOfUs
- **Founded:** 2011 | **Focus:** Corporate accountability campaigns
- **Strengths:** Well-funded ($15M+ annually); professional campaign management; real policy wins
- **Weaknesses:** Top-down (staff choose campaigns, not community); limited user agency; no platform for user-generated demands
- **Our advantage:** Democratic. Users create and govern their own demands. We're a platform, not a campaign organization.

#### Buycott (App)
- **Founded:** 2013 | **Focus:** Consumer boycott coordination
- **Strengths:** Barcode scanning for ethical shopping; clear UX
- **Weaknesses:** Essentially abandoned (last meaningful update 2019); never achieved network effects; no corporate engagement mechanism
- **Our advantage:** Active development, corporate response features, community governance.

#### Reddit (r/boycott, r/antiwork, etc.)
- **Strengths:** Massive engaged communities; real-time discussion
- **Weaknesses:** No structure for demands; no way to measure outcomes; discussions fragment across subreddits; no corporate engagement mechanism
- **Our advantage:** Purpose-built tools for organizing, measuring, and winning.

### Regulatory & Legal Landscape

#### United States
- **First Amendment:** Strong protection for consumer organizing and corporate criticism
- **Anti-SLAPP laws:** 31 states have anti-SLAPP statutes protecting public participation (speaking out against companies)
- **Section 230:** Platform immunity for user-generated content (we're not liable for what users write in demands)
- **FTC considerations:** If we facilitate boycotts, we must ensure they don't constitute illegal group boycotts under antitrust law (consumer boycotts are generally legal; competitor boycotts are not)
- **Key case law:** *NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware* (1982) — Supreme Court ruled consumer boycotts are protected First Amendment activity

#### European Union
- **GDPR:** Must comply for EU users (we do — Firebase handles EU data residency)
- **Digital Services Act (2024):** Platform transparency requirements; we must have clear content moderation policies and reporting mechanisms
- **Consumer Rights Directive:** Our "demand" concept aligns with EU consumer protection philosophy
- **Opportunity:** EU regulatory environment is favorable to consumer organizing platforms

#### United Kingdom
- **Defamation Act 2013:** Higher bar for defamation claims (must show "serious harm") — favorable for consumer criticism platforms
- **Consumer Rights Act 2015:** Provides legal framework for consumer collective action
- **Online Safety Act 2023:** Requires age verification and content moderation — compliance needed

#### Risk Mitigation
1. **Legal review of demands:** AI-assisted screening for potentially defamatory content before publication
2. **Safe harbor compliance:** Clear ToS establishing platform status (not publisher)
3. **Insurance:** Media liability insurance ($2M policy, ~$5K/year for startup)
4. **Legal counsel:** Retained First Amendment attorney on advisory board

### Detailed Financial Model (5-Year)

| Metric | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |

| **Headcount** | 5 | 15 | 40 | 80 | 150 |
| **Burn rate/mo** | $125K | $417K | $1.25M | $2.9M | - |
| **Runway needed** | $1.5M | $5M | $15M | Cash flow+ | Profitable |

### Key Assumptions
1. **Viral coefficient:** 1.3 (each user brings 1.3 new users via sharing demands)
2. **Retention:** 40% MAU/MAU (comparable to Reddit; petition sites are <5%)
3. **Premium conversion:** 1% Y1 → 3.75% Y5 (comparable to Spotify freemium)
4. **Win rate improvement:** As platform grows, corporate response rate increases (network effects + media attention)
5. **Corporate response fees:** Companies pay $500-$5,000 to officially respond to demands (introduced Y2)
